# 3D Character Animation with Scroll-Based Interaction

This project uses `THREE.js`, `GLTFLoader`, and `GSAP` to create a 3D animated character that moves and rotates based on the user's scroll actions. The animation is responsive to different screen sizes, ensuring compatibility across devices.

## Features

- **3D Model Rendering**: The 3D character (bee) is rendered using `THREE.js` and loaded with `GLTFLoader`.
- **Scroll-based Interaction**: The model moves and rotates depending on the user's scroll position relative to sections on the page.
- **Animation**: Smooth transitions and animations are handled using `GSAP`.
- **Responsive Design**: The 3D scene adjusts to window resizing, maintaining responsiveness on desktop and mobile devices.
  
## Technologies Used

- [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) – For rendering the 3D scene and model.
- [GLTFLoader](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/loaders/GLTFLoader) – To load 3D models.
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) – For smooth animations.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript – Basic web technologies.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    - Make sure your project has access to the required CDN links for `THREE.js`, `GLTFLoader`, and `GSAP` as included in the code.

3. Add your `.glb` model file to the root folder or specify the correct path in the script.

4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the 3D character animation in action.

## Usage

- **Scroll to interact**: Scroll through the sections (`banner`, `intro`, `description`, `contact`) to make the 3D model move and rotate.
- **Responsive adjustments**: The scene automatically resizes and adjusts based on your device's window size.

## File Structure

```
/project-root
  |- index.html
  |- main.js
  |- style.css
  |- demon_bee_full_texture.glb
```

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure for the page.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file handling 3D scene rendering and animations.
- `style.css`: Styling for the sections and layout.
- `demon_bee_full_texture.glb`: The 3D model file (replace with your model if necessary).
